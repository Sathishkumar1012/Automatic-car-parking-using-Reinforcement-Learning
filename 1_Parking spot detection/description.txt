Firstly,we have to identify the empty parking spots to train our agent. 
For this, we first find the required area using opencv.
Then we find the contours using edge,canny detection.
Then we do the hough line transform to find the lanes available.From this we find the parking spots.
Using this spots,we find the occupied and unoccupied spots. 
We store this into a csv file, for later part of the execution.
